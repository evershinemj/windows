# **search location**
> this is **crucial** to whether the file/directory will be successfully found

# search method
> basically, there are two search methods:
> 1. search in all subdirectories
> 2. search in current directory
this can be configured in the *search tab* popping up after ctrl+f is pressed

# hot search
> note that the way windows searches is `hot search`, or `incremental search`, namely:
> you don't need to press enter to confirm search string. search string is automatically updated each time you enter a char 

# quick access
> when **search location** is `quick access`, all folders in `quick access` will be searched recursively(if **search method** is `search in all subdirectories`)

# find specific files after ctrl+o
> note that you can use date info(especially today) to find specific files
