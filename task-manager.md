# search for a process
note that you can search for a process by **just typing the name of that process**, **without ctrl-f**

# details
- the search engine might use some algorithm similar to that in vim maps.
- typing only one letter jumps to the first process beginning with that letter.
- typing two letters successively jumps to the process whose first two letters match the two letters typed.
- typing two letters with an interval of several seconds perform as if they're typed one by one. hence two searches are conducted.
- if two letters are not enough to locate the search, type more successively.
